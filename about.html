                <p style="color: black;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; "> I love the
                    freedom that working myself gives me, I am currently in my final year pursuing
                    a bachelor's degree in computer science at the College of Science and Technology.I have a strong
                    interest in software development.
                    And even I was born and raised in the Gahini Sector of the Eastern province. I now reside in kigali
                    , Nyarugenge , due to my studies. My hobby is spending more time with friends and family, as wellas
                    reading books.
                </p> <br>
                <p style="color: black;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; "> Throughout
                    my academic journey, , I've been involved in different activities
                    and projects outside of classes. I've taken part in coding contests and worked with others on group
                    assignments.
                    These experiences have helped me learn new things and see how what I learn in class applies in real
                    life.
                    I'm really interested in technology, so I like to keep up with the latest developments.
                    Whether it's trying out new computer languages or testing out new software, I enjoy learning
                    and keeping my skills sharp in the fast-changing world of technology. </p> <br><br>
