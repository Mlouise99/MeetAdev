            <h3>Online Reservation Booking Services System</h3>
            <p> I did this project when I was in high school in order to streamline and simplify the process of booking
                various
                services, such as rooms or conference halls, by providing users with a convenient and efficient platform
                accessible from anywhere. Its purpose is to eliminate the hassle of traditional booking methods by
                allowing users to make reservations quickly and easily through an intuitive online interface.
                Whether for personal or professional use, this system offers users the flexibility to schedule
                appointments
                or reserve spaces according to their needs, thereby enhancing convenience and optimizing resource
                utilization for both service providers and customers.</p>
